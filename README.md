## Scaffold Layers (Added November 2025)

This project now includes a scalable folder structure and core packages for future expansion.

- These are placeholders only — no logic or UI implemented yet.
- Existing demo code remains unchanged.
- Future commits can progressively fill in the use cases, repositories, and services.
